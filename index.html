          <div class="question">What is the schedule of events?</div>
          <div class="answer">We are offering a complimentary meet 'n greet on Friday for those who are able to stay the entire weekend. Come early and catch up with friends and family!

            <br><br>Saturday is a free day for exploring the resort, enjoying time with friends and family, and relaxing. See the <a href="#schedule">activities section</a> for more specifics on Saturday activities.

            <br><br>We are officially celebrating Charles and Bonnie's 50th wedding anniversary during the luncheon on Sunday.</div>

          <div class="question">Do I need to spend the night at the resort?</div>
          <div class="answer">No. You can choose to drive to the resort just for the luncheon and return home afterward.</div>

          <div class="question">If I want to spend the night, what are the accommodations?</div>
          <div class="answer">If you opt to stay at the resort, you are responsible for booking your own accommodations. 

            <br><br>There are <a href="https://www.barnsleyresort.com/accommodations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multiple options at the resort</a>. There are cottages, which can have one bedroom or multiple bedrooms. You can book a single room in a cottage for one family, or you can book an entire cottage with multiple rooms for a large family or multiple families. 

            <br><br>You can also book a room at the inn, which is more of a hotel-style setting. We have 15 rooms reserved at the inn for our event. You can call the resort at <a href="tel:8777732447">877.773.2447</a> to make whichever reservation you prefer.</div>

          <div class="question">What type of activities are available?</div>
          <div class="answer">A list of activities at the resort is available <a href="https://www.barnsleyresort.com/recreation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. You are responsible for booking any activities you would like to participate in during your stay.

            <br><br>However, we are arranging group clay shooting and group spa activities for Saturday. If you'd like to join one of these activities in particular, please book them separately through the resort and mention our event to join our groups.

            <br><br>Please check our event website for other fun complementary activities, including a fire pit with s'mores, scavenger hunt, and more!</div>

          <div class="question">What is the deadline to RSVP?</div>
          <div class="answer">Please RSVP for the luncheon and meet 'n' greet to Laura by Friday, October 7, 2022. 

            <br><br>Please also have any accommodations and activities booked through the resort by that time as well.</div>

          <div class="question">Are children welcome?</div>
          <div class="answer">We love children and they are welcome to come to the resort for the weekend, but we ask that Sunday's luncheon be for adults only. We also ask that you be responsible for your own children for the weekend if you choose to bring them. However, we are offering childcare for the luncheon. Please let us know when you RSVP if you will need to utilize this service.</div>

          <div class="question">Should we bring gifts?</div>
          <div class="answer">No gifts, please. After 50 years of marriage, Charles and Bonnie have all the material items they need and would love your presence most of all.</div>
