          <div class="welcome-title">Morello Fiftieth Wedding Anniversary Celebration</div>
          <p>Thank you for joining us as we celebrate the fiftieth wedding anniversary of my parents, Bonnie and Charles Morello!</p>
  
          <p>I am incredibly grateful to my parents for their example of genuine love. As their relationship has persevered through difficult seasons, they have shown me sacrifice, hard work, warm affection, stubborn perseverance, and the power of forgiveness. Charles and Bonnie are very different from each other! Who would think that the young love between a Catholic boy and a Methodist girl would stand the test of time? Their marriage is a beautiful and timely reminder that love can transcend all boundaries.</p>
  
          <p>Bonnie and Charles do not know about this event yet, so let's keep it a surprise! It will mean so much to them to be surrounded by dear friends and family, coming together to affirm their love and our love for them. Please help me make this celebration one to remember!</p>
  
          <p>Fondly,<br>
          Laura Morello Harris</p>
